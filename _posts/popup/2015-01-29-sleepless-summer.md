I've entered thinkable.org's Open Innovation Award. [Vote for my idea](http://thinkable.org/submission/2110) to help me win $5000 in research funding!

I'm investigating the relationships between temperature, humidity and public health. Studies on smaller groups of people have shown that humid heat at night can seriously affect sleep quality ([1](http://www.journalsleep.org/ViewAbstract.aspx?pid=24155))([2](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00484-004-0237-z)), and I want to repeat this work on a larger group in Sydney using wrist-based sleep trackers. The results will help us understand how the public's relationship to climate changes when we're asleep, which could lead to better heat alerts.
