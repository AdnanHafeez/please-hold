                <p>When I'm not in academia, I make animated videos for people! I can help you get
                    your message across to just about any audience possible, whether you want your
                    clients and customers to know what makes your business special or your staff to
                    get excited about a company initiative.</p>
                <p>I can help you with the entire process, starting with what you want to achieve,
                    who your audience is and where you want them to see the video. I'll storyboard
                    the concept, go back and forth with you until you're happy with it, then whip
                    the whole thing up. I can even help you with deployment, whether you want to put
                    it on YouTube for the world to see, in a blog post (or both!) or send it to clients
                    for secure internal viewing.</p>

                <p>I've helped clients out with other video-related tasks, including:</p>

                    <li>reformatting  video for further use (including resizing, cropping and
                        transcoding), and</li>
