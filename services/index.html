        <p>When I'm not in academia, I make animated videos for people! I can help you get
            your message across to just about any audience possible, whether you want your
            clients and customers to know what makes your business special or your staff to
            get excited about a company initiative.</p>
        <p>I can help you with the entire process, starting with what you want to achieve,
            who your audience is and where you want them to see the video. I'll storyboard
            the concept, go back and forth with you until you're happy with it, then whip
            the whole thing up. I can even help you with deployment, whether you want to put
            it on YouTube for the world to see, in a blog post (or both!) or send it to clients
            for secure internal viewing.</p>

            <li>re-cutting video footage,</li>
            <li>building and compositing things like overlays ("James Goldie: Concerned
                Citizen"),</li>
            <li>reformatting  video for further use (including resizing, cropping and
                transcoding), and</li>
