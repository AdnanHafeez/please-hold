Hackathons, where you design, prototype or code tech solutions to problems from a Friday night to Sunday night, generally wipe me out now that I stick to a 9-to-5 for my day job.

But, creatively and intellectually, it's great to be thrown a problem and told that you're going to ship a solution in 48 hours whether you like it or not. In a PhD it's easy to have weeks when you just don't want to deal with your work; spending a weekend making appreciable progress on something useful that you're not tied to for the next half-decade is a nice reset. 

[HealthHack](healthhack.com.au) particularly hit my sweet spot: I got to develop skills that I'm interested in folding into my career stack, and I got to apply them to problems that have obvious social value. Rather than writing about what we built, I can show you our pitch:

<iframe style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhealthhackcbr%2Fvideos%2F1802345186650778%2F&width=500&show_text=false&appId=1583566641860122&height=500" width="500" height="500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true"></iframe>

Our prototype went down really well with the judges: we won the **Commercial Potential Award**, which includes some AWS and Azure credit, some Github subs, and two months of access to the [Entry29](http://entry29.org.au/) coworking space to develop the idea further. We're talking about developing this into an app in the short-term for clinicians to prescribe to people, but I'm also really excited to see it developed using a chatbot platform like [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/rensa), which [Facebook Messenger](http://messenger.com/platform) uses.

Now, back to that paper.
