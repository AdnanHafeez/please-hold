# Please Hold
_Track the time you waste with Centrelink.

Please Hold is a time tracking app designed for Australians who receive welfare payments. Use PH whenever you have to do something to keep your payment going: go into a Centrelink office, call someone, fill in a form. PH asks you when things happened and records each interaction. You can then view your interaction history and see statistics on how much time you've wasted each week/month/year.

PH is designed to be used locally: all of the important stuff is stored in localStorage, so there's no need to worry about personal information drifting off into the cloud. This also means that PH ought to work offline for the most part.
