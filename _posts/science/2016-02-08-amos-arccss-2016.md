_Many heat stress indices are actively used to draw inferences about the health impacts of temperature and humidity, but there is no consensus on which indices are the most appropriate. We set out to investigate the best way to model the effect of human heat stress on hospital admissions. Which heat stress indices are most appropriate, and do those change with location?_

I presented this poster at the AMOS-ARCCSS National Conference in February 2016. A high-quality version of the poster is available at [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293488271_Epidemiological_model_design_for_the_comparison_of_heat_stress_indices_when_modelling_Sydney_hospital_admissions).
