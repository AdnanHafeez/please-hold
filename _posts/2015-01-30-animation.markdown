I used to be a freelance animator! I made ads for small businesses and entered ([and won](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9twu1h7vxY&list=PLAU1kotoDhrwmKwfvTssxmI7mHg485GhN)!) video competitions. Then I [took an arrow in the knee](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-took-an-arrow-in-the-knee). I still put those skills to use [explaining science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YZxqRM97eo), though.

My videos can generally be found on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/rensadotco).
