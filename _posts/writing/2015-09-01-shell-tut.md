If you haven't used a command line extensively but know what they are or have other programming experience, you might find another tutorial more useful. This page is targeted at people who avoid coding like the plague and last saw a command line [illuminating Chris Hemsworth's lovely face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ1ZDlLImF8).

If you're one of these people, you might not even really understand why you need to learn this stuff: maybe a colleague or supervisor asked you to SSH into a server at work to rename 1500 files and sent you this way after seeing your entirely blank expression. Maybe you're like me and you wondered how to do a statistical analysis on an 8 gigabyte file when it crashed in Excel.

Either way, this tutorial's first task is to sell you on the benefits of using the command line.

### <a name="whats-in-a-shell"></a>What's a shell?

Broadly speaking, shells are interfaces—ways to work with computers. The desktops, icons and buttons that make up the Windows and Mac OS X interfaces constitute graphical shells. But you can also give a computer text-based commands, and those interfaces are usually what people mean when they talk about using a shell.

Because shells can be used to do many of the same sorts of things graphical interfaces do (and a fair few they don't), it can be pretty hard to get a solid conceptual basis of them. The easiest way to think of them, to start with, is as a file manager, like Finder or File Explorer:

{% include figure.html url='/img/shell-tut/fig2b.gif' description='Looking at a folder in the Finder app on a Mac.' %}

{% include figure.html url='/img/shell-tut/fig2a.gif' description='A view of the same folder on the Terminal app on Mac, which uses Bash. Everything up to the dollar sign ($) is a prompt; type commands like ls in at the prompt and hit Enter to make stuff happen.' %}

Like graphics file managers, shells have a working directory (folder), and they'll operate on that directory unless you tell them otherwise. In the above figure, the Terminal app (which is really a popular shell called bash, which we'll use in this article) and Finder are both displaying the contents of a directory, then changing to a subdirectory and displaying its contents.

When you open a shell, you're given a **prompt**. That's the computer *prompting* you to command it. Makes sense, no? Prompts can be infinitely variable, and people like to dress 'em up to include information like their username or their current working directory. Sometimes they're coloured; sometimes they're not. But whatever you see preceding the cursor when you open a shell up is usually the prompt.

We can act on stuff too—like renaming a file...

{% include figure.html url='/img/shell-tut/fig3.gif' description='This is where the magic happens! Okay, maybe not a great sales pitch...' %}

... which isn't really any more impressive than doing it in the Finder. But what if you wanted to rename a thousand files?

{% include figure.html url='/img/shell-tut/fig4b.gif' description='... But this looks pretty painful, right? You value your time more than this.' %}

{% include figure.html url='/img/shell-tut/fig4a.gif' description='Better, eh?' %}

With a graphical shell, you'd be sitting there for hours, renaming them one at a time like a chump. (Okay, smartarse, [some systems do have basic batch renaming.](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19067)) What if you wanted to sort a thousand files into subdirectories based on the year they were created? Shells start to look more attractive when you want:

- to repeat or *iterate* a task many times,
- to have work feed from one program to another automatically,
- to work on a remote computer (eg. a computer at work when you're at home, or a computer at home when you're on the road), or
- to do (d) all of the above.

Plus, a lot of academic software only runs on the command line, so let's face it: you're getting pushed into the pool one way or another.
